# sm-seasonality
Public repository for scripts used in altimetry study of meso- and submesoscale seasonality. These are used to generate graphs and data in the draft paper "Seasonality and spatial dependence in meso- and submesoscale ocean dynamics from satellite altimetry". Combines with publically accessible data from the Jason-2 satellite, the ECCO-4 climatology, and ERA-5 reanalysis data, one should be able to reproduce the results in this work.
